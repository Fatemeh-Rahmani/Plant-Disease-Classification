# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification

**Machine Learning & Deep Learning Approaches**

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that explore **plant disease classification** using both **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate different modeling approaches for image-based plant disease detection and to compare their strengths, limitations, and performance.

Early detection of plant diseases plays a crucial role in improving agricultural productivity and reducing crop losses. Automated classification systems can assist farmers and agricultural experts by providing fast and scalable diagnostic tools.
